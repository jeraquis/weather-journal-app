# Weather-Journal App Project

## Function
UI allows user to input their mood and zip code. The UI then updates to record the date, location, weather, and user's mood.

## Techniques Used
This project creates an asynchronous web app that uses OpenWeather Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
